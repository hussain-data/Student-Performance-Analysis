## 📖 Overview

This project presents an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the "Student Performance" dataset. The primary goal is to uncover insights into the factors that influence student scores in math, reading, and writing. By analyzing various demographic and socio-economic variables, this study aims to identify key determinants of academic success.

The analysis explores relationships between variables such as **gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch status**, and **test preparation course completion** against student performance metrics.


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **StudentsPerformance.csv** file. It contains 1,000 records of student data with the following features:

* `gender`: The gender of the student (female/male).
* `race/ethnicity`: The student's racial or ethnic group (group A, B, C, D, E).
* `parental level of education`: The highest level of education attained by the student's parent(s).
* `lunch`: Whether the student receives standard or free/reduced lunch.
* `test preparation course`: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.
* `math score`: The student's score in the math exam.
* `reading score`: The student's score in the reading exam.
* `writing score`: The student's score in the writing exam.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

This analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The core libraries leveraged for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization are:

* **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For making attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## 📈 Analysis & Key Findings

The exploratory data analysis involved several stages, including data cleaning, univariate analysis, and bivariate analysis to understand the relationships between different variables.

### Key Questions Addressed:
* How do demographic factors like gender and race/ethnicity correlate with academic scores?
* What is the impact of parental education and lunch status on student performance?
* Does completing a test preparation course lead to higher scores?
* Is there a correlation between scores in different subjects (math, reading, and writing)?

### Summary of Findings:
* **[Finding 1]**: *Example: Female students, on average, scored higher in reading and writing, while male students performed slightly better in math.*
* **[Finding 2]**: *Example: Students who completed the test preparation course consistently outperformed those who did not across all three subjects.*
* **[Finding 3]**: *Example: There is a strong positive correlation between reading and writing scores, suggesting that skills in one area are highly transferable to the other.*
